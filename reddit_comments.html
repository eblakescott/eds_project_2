<h3>This is a space for cleaned-up comments. These comments will then be inputted, one-by-one, into a web-based text-analysis tool. Unclean JSON data for comments is shown in the script: comment data includes status (approved or not), commentTitle, and so on. For the purposes of my current research I am only interested in the comment body text.</h3>
