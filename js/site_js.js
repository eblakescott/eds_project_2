I found the JSON view extension for Firefox to be helpful when trying to decipher the JSON data: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/jsonview/. 

The goal of the project is to do a word count function of the body text of one comment and then to get its type-token ratio (i.e., the number of unique words in the text / the total number of words).

There are no ancient cities or libraries from prehistoric times. We would have some evidence of them by now, or at least some clues about it.

In 1855 Walt Whitman promulgated an ecstatic and exalted vision of democracy in \"song of Myself.\" Several decades later in his \"democratic Vistas\" he descended into despair when confronted with the crass reality of social division, greed, the ascent of the robber barons which dashed the optimism he nurtured in 1855. These two works of a great American writer mirror the statements of Dr. Krugman and Mr. James. To my great chagrin I must side with Mr. James.",
